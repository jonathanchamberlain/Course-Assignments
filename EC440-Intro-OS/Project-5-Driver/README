ADDER.C
	THIS IS A C SOURCE CODE FOR A DEVICE DRIVER. IN WRITE MODE, THE DRIVER TAKES INTEGER INPUTS AND ADDS THEM
TO A RUNNING SUM, AND IN READ MODE THE DRIVER READS THE SUM OUT TO THE PROCESS THAT CALLED THE DRIVER. AT MOST ONE
DEVICE CAN ACCESS THE DRIVER AT ANY TIME.

	DUE TO ERRORS ENCOUNTERED, THE DEVICE USES DYNAMIC MAJOR NUMBER SELECTION (IE, IS NOT HARD CODED TO 200) AND
DOES NOT ALLOW SEPERATE READ/WRITE ACCESS.

INIT_MODULE:
	SERVES AS A WRAPPER FOR STANDARD REGISTER_CHRDEV FUNCTION TO REGISTER THE KERNEL OBJECT, AND PRINTS STATEMENTS
TO THE KERNEL LOG TO INDICATE THE MAJOR DEVICE NUMBER ASSGINED.

CLEANUP_MODULE:
	SERVES AS A WRAPPER FOR FOR UNREGSITER_CHRDEV FUNCTION TO UNREGISTER THE KERNEL OBJECT.

DEVICE_OPEN:
	CHECKS WHETHER A DEVICE HAS HAS THE DRIVER OPEN (DEPENDING ON MODE SELECTED), AND IF THE
DRIVER IS AVAILABLE THE CALLS TRY_MODULE_GET TO GET THE MODULE.

DEVICE_RELEASE:
	DECREMENTS THE DEVICE_OPEN COUNTER, THEN CALLS MODULE_PUT TO RELEASE. 

DEVICE_READ:
	FIRST CHECKS IF THE SUM HAS BEEN UPDATED, USING THE ISUPDATED FLAG - IF SO (ISUPDATED = 1), CREATES A STRING CONSISTING OF 
  THE SUM AS OF THAT MOMENT. IF NOT (ISUPDATED=0) IMMEDIATELY RETURNS 0 TO REPRESENT EOF, AND RESETS ISUPDATED TO 1 TO 
  ENABLE THE NEXT READ CALL TO READ OUT THE SUM, IN ORDER TO MATCH WITH EXPECTED BEHAVIOR FROM SYSTEM CALL READS SUCH AS CAT. 
  IF NOT RETURNED IN PREVIOUS STEP, WRITES THE STRING TO THE BUFFER.

DEVICE_WRITE
	READS FROM THE BUFFER IN ORDER TO PARSE OUT THE INPUT AND ADD INTEGERS TO THE SUM.
        WHILE LOOPING THROUGH THE BUFFER, THE DRIVER TAKES THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS IN RESPONSE TO ENOUNCTERED INPUT:
        DETECTS AN INTEGER CHARACTER (O THROUGH 9):
		SETS THE FLAG TO INDICATE GETTING THE NEXT TERM (GETTERM) TO 1 IF NOT ALREADY DONE SO, AND THEN ADDS THE NEW DIGIT TO THE
		NEXT TERM OF THE SUM BY PERFORMING THE CALCULATION TERM*10 + (DIGIT-'0') TO CONVERT THE DIGIT TO AN INTEGER AND
		THEN ADD IT TO THE TERM, ACCOUNTING FOR THE FACT THAT THE DIGITS ARE BEING READ IN LEFT TO RIGHT.
	DETECTS WHITESPACE OR A NULL TERMINATOR (\0):
		IF CURRENTLY GETTING THE NEXT TERM, ADDS (OR SUBTRACTS, IF NEGATIVE) THE TERM TO THE SUM, RESETS THE TERM TO 0
		RESETS THE GETTERM, IS NEGATIVE NUMNBER (ISNEG) FLAGS TO 0, AND ISUPDATED TO 1.
	DETECTS THE - CHARACTER, AND NOT CURRENTLY GETTING A TERM:
		SETS THE ISNEG AND GETTERM FLAGS TO 1
	DETECTS ANY OTHER CHARACTER (INCLUDING - WHILE GETTING A TERM):
		PRINTS AN ERROR MESSAGE TO THE KERNEL LOG, THEN RESETS THE TERM TO 0 (IMMEDIATELY THROWING IT OUT, EVEN IF 
		CURRENTLY NON ZERO), AS WELL AS RESETTING THE FLAGS FOR ISNEG AND GETTERM TO 0. -EINVAL IS RETURNED, CAUSING
		IMMEDIATE EXIT.

	IF THE FULL BUFFER IS WRITTEN OUT, RETURNS THE NUMBER OF BYTES READ IN.
