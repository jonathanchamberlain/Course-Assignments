\subsubsection*{Cri-o}

In this subsection we describe how we evaluate selected benchmark checks within the cri-o runtime. The process for implementing a particular benchmark check is similar to those within Docker and Containerd.

As before, we again find the container's pid. However, in cri-o this is contained within the state.json file, as opposed to inspecting an init.pid file: \textit{/var/lib/containers/storage/overlay-containers/} \textit{<container-id>/userdata/state.json}

However, once the pid is obtained, the process to verify benchmarks \textbf{5.1 Do not disable AppArmor Profile} and \textbf{5.2 Verify SELinux security options} is again identical to that in Docker as with the pid we can use procfs to find the AppArmor and SELinux attributes. 

To determine the cgroup path of the container, we again find the corresponding attribute in the configuration json file:
\textit{//var/lib/containers/storage/overlay-containers/} \textit{<container-id>/userdata/config.json} file.
From this file, we get \textbf{cgroup} path of a given container. Exposing this value also corresponds to \textbf{5.24} benchmark.

Further, by using the cgroup path, we are able to validate benchmark \textbf{5.24} directly, as well as leverage \textit{sysfs} to validate benchmarks \textbf{5.10, 5.11, 5.28} as in Docker and containerd.
