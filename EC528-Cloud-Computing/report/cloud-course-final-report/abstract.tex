The Open Container Initiative (OCI) was established to create a open standard for container use regardless of the runtime used to manage the container. However, OCI is limited to specifying downloading of the image and unpacking that image into an OCI Runtime filesystem bundle. It does not contain any specifications for lifecycle management of containers. As a result, there are multiple container runtimes in use, each implementing lifecycle functionality in a different manner. Related, the OCI does not does not ensure consistent standards for the security of containers or images are present across different runtimes. In this project, we study the differences in popular runtimes Docker, containerd, and cri-o. Our focus is on developing an interoperable application focused on running Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks across runtimes. While written for Docker, most benchmarks are general, e.g. ensuring that memory usage limits exist. As a result, we can ensure consistent application of security principles irrespective of container runtime differences.
