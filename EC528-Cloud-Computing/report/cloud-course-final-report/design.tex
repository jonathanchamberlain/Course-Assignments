As the intent is to examine containers and their associated images to validate they meet the security benchmarks, the Interopable Application and the Interoperable Image Application need exposure to the container and image configuration files, as well as sysfs and procfs. Thus, the applications are deployed on the cluster hosting the containers to be inspected, and exist between the user and the container.

The applications are implemented in Python version 3. At present, the applications are implemented as separate standalone scripts which are called with a specified runtime and container ID on the command line. This was done largely to provide proof of concept that performing the checks are possible, and to facilitate testing. Combining the applications into a single service is part of future work discussed in a later section.

In addition, there is a separate helper function, the Image Approval Manager that works with the Interoperable Image Application. This manager simply takes image ids and adds them to a list of approved images or blocked/unapproved images. This helps to facilitate one of the benchmark checks outlined in the section on container image benchmarks.
