Primitive Network Monitor and statisitics collection - final project for EC 441

https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html - ipaddress module documentation
Can specify whitelist by address block - ipaddress has method to generate the addresses from the IPv4 Network
Otherwise, can compare the IP address to the network block directly

For whitelist

Loop until user indicates they are done

On loop - Get input

Validate that input is valid IP, has valid netmask if present

If valid, write to whtielist.


When comparing IPv4 addresses 

On startup, load whitelist from file:
  - Take inputs, and use to make IPv4Network object
  - store in array of network objects

On packet receipt, compare source IP to whitelist:
  - if IPv4Address is in a IPv4Network, allow packet to proceed; if it is in none of the networks, block packet, p
  rint error message
  - Record packet stats (IP addr, option flags set, etc), write to appropriate stats file


Socket module should be able to get the associated host name to each IP address (for printing in stats files)
